Data Types
number - int, float
string - a collection of chars
boolean - true/false

variable declartion -
var = 32 => integer
dbl = 90.65 => string
str = "hello" => string
flag = false => boolean

Input from end user
var = input("Enter the number:")
print(type(var))

printing to console/reading from keyboard the datatypes which is associated with the value is always a string

conversion function - this method convert one data type to another
int() - convert string to int
float() - convert string to float
str() - converts number/bool to string

var = int(input("enter the number : ")) - first input will be read from the keyboard and then converted to integer value and assigned to the var

Q1. To calculate area of circle where radius is provided by the end user

  - calculate area using the formula area = 3.141*rad*rad
  - print aread

Q2. Write down a program which takes user input for principle, rate and time, based on user input calculate the simple interest the user has to pay

rate-double
time-int
SI = (P*R*T)/100
